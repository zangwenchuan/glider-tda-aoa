# Glider AOA Inference + TDA

This repository provides support code for:
- AOA (angle-of-attack) inference via Actor-Critic/DDPG (TensorFlow2)
- TDA (transducer data assimilaiton)

The code is designed to reproduce the *methodological pipeline* described in the paper.
A public demo parameter set and synthetic data are provided to ensure that all scripts are runnable.

## Data Description

The original sea-trial data are confidential and not publicly released.
A synthetic demo dataset (`data/demo.csv`) is provided for reproducibility.
